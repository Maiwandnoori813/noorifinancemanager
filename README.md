# Noori Finance — Investment Simulator (Single-page, GitHub-ready)

This is a simple, local-first investment simulator built for Maiwand (Noori Finance).
It includes:
- smooth glowing line charts (Chart.js)
- monthly compounding simulation using a user-set profit rate
- manual transactions (add/take) that recompute forward months
- three switchable themes (Dark Futuristic, Glass Minimal, White & Teal)
- language toggle: English / Pashto (پښتو)
- data saved in browser localStorage (no login required)

## How to use (quick)
1. Unzip the package and open `index.html` in your browser to try locally.
2. To publish on GitHub Pages:
   - Create a repository on GitHub (e.g. `NooriFinance`).
   - Upload all files from this ZIP to the repo (you can drag & drop in the web UI).
   - In GitHub repo -> Settings -> Pages -> Source -> choose `main` branch and `/ (root)` -> Save.
   - After a minute your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/NooriFinance/`

If you want me to push this to a GitHub repo and deploy it for you, I can prepare the repo and give you the link — otherwise, uploading the ZIP is enough.

Made with care — enjoy!
